# Seed: Small Code Snippets to help with HTML & CSS

This project was initially built for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate.

Building this project was a great chance to play around with making a small Design System â€” and record useful Code Snippets I repeatedly use across different projects.

Feel free to borrow, copy or re-use anything you find here.

This is all open source.
